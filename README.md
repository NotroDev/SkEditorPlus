# 💀 Dead?
Not at all! SkEditor+ is currently being rewritten to run faster and better, with added support for Linux and macOS. For more details, head over to our Discord server!

# 🐧 Linux?
I'm sorry, but I can't release SkEditor+ without rewriting it to another framework or language (but it's my future plan!). You can try this, though: [Linux workaround](https://github.com/NotroDev/SkEditorPlus/wiki/Linux-workaround)

# 🥺 Maybe at least Windows 7?
I'm sorry again, but it isn't possible. SkEditor+ runs on .NET 6, which isn't supported by Windows 7. I won't change the version to the older one.


# 🔧 Tech stack
SkEditor+ is written in WPF, C#, using HandyControls for the front end and AvalonEdit for the editor.

# 📣 Spread the word!
If you would like to support us and promote SkEditor+, you can:
- Add a GitHub Star to the project!
- Recommend to friends!
- Use built-in Discord RPC!
- Maybe you'll come up with something else?

# 💵 Donations?
Some people have been asking me about donations. I'm not keen on setting up a donation system because it comes with issues, and honestly, I don't think anyone would be interested in donating. However, if you do want to contribute, just hit me up on Discord - `@notrodev`. I'll do my best to figure out the most suitable approach.
