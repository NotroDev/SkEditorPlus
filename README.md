# üêß Linux?
I'm sorry, but I can't release SkEditor+ without rewriting it to another framework or language I know less. You can try using something like [Wine](https://www.winehq.org), but I can't officially support it.

# ü•∫ Maybe at least Windows 7?
I'm sorry again, but it isn't possible. SkEditor+ runs on .NET 6, which is not supported by Windows 7. I won't change the version to the older one.


# üîß Tech stack
SkEditor+ is written in WPF, C#, using HandyControls for the front end and AvalonEdit for the editor.

# üì£ Spread the word!
If you would like to support us and promote SkEditor+, you can:
- Add a GitHub Star to the project!
- Recommend to friends!
- Use built-in Discord RPC!
- Maybe you'll come up with something else?
